# ComfyUI-RvTools-X

ComfyUI-RvTools is a collection of custom nodes, helpers and utilities for ComfyUI designed to make workflow building easier and more reliable. It includes convenience nodes for loading checkpoints and pipelines, type conversions, folder and filename helpers, simple image utilities, logic and flow helpers, and small toolkits for working with VAE/CLIP and latents.

Note: Workflows created with RvTools_v2 are NOT compatible with this version. This release contains a substantial cleanup and many improvements.

## Highlights

- **Advanced Checkpoint Loaders:** Multiple loader variants including v3/v4 series with CLIP ensemble support (up to 4 CLIP modules), Flux compatibility, weight dtype control, and pipe-based outputs for complex workflows.
- **Sophisticated Pipe Ecosystem:** Standardized data interchange system with context pipes, generation data pipes, concatenation, and extraction nodes to eliminate spaghetti connections in complex workflows. (More detailed documentation can be found below.)
- **Comprehensive Switching System:** Extensive switch and multi-switch nodes for all ComfyUI data types, enabling dynamic workflow branching and conditional execution.
- **Advanced Text Processing:** Prompt generation with environment/subject sliders, random prompt systems, multiline string inputs, and regex-based string replacement.
- **Video Workflow Tools:** Video clip combination, seamless joining, WAN frame helpers, loop calculators, and video-specific pipe contexts for professional video generation.
- **Sampler Settings Management:** Specialized sampler configurations for Flux, SDXL, and standard models with preset management and pipe-based distribution.
- **Type Conversion Suite:** Comprehensive conversion nodes (Any → Float/Integer/String/Combo), list/batch transformations, mask operations, and string merging utilities.
- **Universal Passers:** Type-safe data passing nodes for all ComfyUI types (models, latents, images, conditioning, pipes, etc.) to maintain data integrity through workflows.
- **Resolution & Settings Presets:** Built-in resolution presets for popular aspect ratios (Flux, SDXL, HiDream, Qwen, etc.) and directory-based settings management.
- **Core Utilities:** VRAM purging helpers, colored console logging, path management, and comprehensive sampler/scheduler lists for all model types.

The nodes live under the `py/` directory and are grouped by function. The `core/` directory contains shared utilities and constants used by the nodes.

## Beginner-friendly installation

The easiest way to install ComfyUI-RvTools is to place it in ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` folder so ComfyUI will discover the nodes automatically.

1. Locate your ComfyUI installation folder.
2. Inside ComfyUI, find (or create) the `custom_nodes` folder.
3. Copy the entire `ComfyUI-RvTools-X` folder into `custom_nodes` so the tree looks like:

```
ComfyUI/
  custom_nodes/
    ComfyUI-RvTools-X/
      py/
      core/
      README.md
      ...
```

Or, clone directly into `custom_nodes`:

```powershell
# from your ComfyUI directory (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI-RvTools-X custom_nodes/ComfyUI-RvTools-X
```

4. Install any optional Python dependencies required by specific nodes. From the repository root (or your ComfyUI root), run:

```powershell
# optional - only if your ComfyUI environment is missing packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI-RvTools-X/requirements.txt

# For ComfyUI portable installations:
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r custom_nodes/ComfyUI-RvTools-X/requirements.txt
```

Common dependencies referenced by nodes include: torch, numpy, Pillow, opencv-python, piexif and others. ComfyUI itself usually provides the main ML stack (torch, torchvision, safetensors), but if you see errors you may need to install missing packages.

5. Restart ComfyUI. The new nodes should appear in the node list under categories provided by the package.

### Opening a console / terminal in the ComfyUI folder (beginner)

If you're new to command lines, here's a very short guide to open a terminal (console) already located in your ComfyUI folder so you can run commands there.

Windows (PowerShell / Windows Terminal):

- Option A — From File Explorer:
  1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the ComfyUI installation folder (the folder that contains `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`, `webui.bat`, `main.py` or similar files).
  2. Hold Shift, right-click on an empty area in the folder and choose "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open in Windows Terminal".

- Option B — From any PowerShell window:
  1. Open PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
  2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```powershell
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
# or using Set-Location
Set-Location 'D:\path\to\ComfyUI'
```

Notes for Windows:
- If your path contains spaces, wrap it in single or double quotes.
- Your default shell may be PowerShell (`pwsh.exe`) or Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`); PowerShell and Windows Terminal are recommended.

macOS / Linux (Terminal):

1. Open Terminal (Spotlight → "Terminal" on macOS, or your terminal emulator on Linux).
2. Change directory to the ComfyUI folder, for example:

```bash
# replace the path below with your actual ComfyUI path
cd /home/you/ComfyUI
```

Tips:
- Use Tab to autocomplete long folder names.
- If you use a Python virtual environment, activate it from the same console before running ComfyUI.

## Quick start — using the Checkpoint Loader

One of the primary nodes is the "Checkpoint Loader [RvTools-X]". It helps load a model checkpoint (and optionally a VAE / baked CLIP) and returns typed objects you can wire into generation pipelines.

- Inputs: checkpoint file, optional VAE selection, resolution presets or custom width/height, batch size, and simple CLIP trimming options.
- Outputs: `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE`, `LATENT`, `STRING` (model name).

Basic usage:

1. Add the Checkpoint Loader node to your graph.
2. Select a checkpoint from the UI file chooser (it looks in your `checkpoints/` folder by default).
3. Choose a VAE (or use the baked one in the checkpoint), set the desired resolution or preset, and set batch size.
4. Connect the `MODEL` output to downstream nodes that expect a model.

The loader includes helpful runtime warnings (legacy checkpoint extensions, very large resolutions, missing VAE falls back to baked VAE) and attempts to detect latent channel counts automatically.

### Advanced Quick Start — Using Pipe-Based Loaders

For more complex workflows, try the advanced pipe-based loaders:

1. Use "Checkpoint Loader v3.1 (Pipe) [RvTools-X]" or "Checkpoint Loader v4.1 (Pipe) [RvTools-X]" for modern workflows.
2. These return a single pipe output containing all components (model, CLIP, VAE, latent, dimensions, etc.).
3. Connect the pipe to "Pipe Out Checkpoint Loader [RvTools-X]" to extract individual components, or connect it directly to the basic Context or Context Video pipes to feed it with the bundled parameters.
4. For Flux models, use the specialized Flux sampler settings nodes like "Sampler Settings (Flux+Seed) [RvTools-X]".

The pipe system dramatically simplifies complex workflows by bundling related parameters into single connections.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- If a node raises an import error for a package, install the missing package into the same Python environment that runs ComfyUI.
- If you place the folder under `custom_nodes` but the nodes don't show up, restart ComfyUI and check the server logs for import errors.

## Node Spotlight: Save Images [RvTools-X]

The **Save Images** node is a highly advanced and flexible output node designed for robust image saving in ComfyUI workflows, offering extensive customization and metadata support.

### Outstanding Abilities
- **Flexible Input Handling:** Accepts images directly via the `images` input or through a connected metadata pipe (`pipe_opt`), allowing saving from any workflow stage or metadata-only operations.
- **Dynamic Output Organization:** Supports customizable output paths and filenames using a rich set of placeholders for automatic organization by date, model, seed, and generation parameters.
- **Comprehensive Metadata Embedding:** Can embed full workflow data, prompts, and generation parameters directly into PNG or WEBP metadata for traceability and reproducibility.
- **Generation Data Preservation:** When enabled, saves all generation parameters (prompts, model info, sampler, seed, CFG, steps, etc.) as embedded metadata and/or as a separate JSON file alongside images.
- **Lora and Embedding Hashing:** Automatically extracts and hashes used Loras and embeddings from prompts, storing short hashes for Civitai compatibility.
- **UI Integration and Previews:** Optionally returns preview data for ComfyUI's UI, including filenames and subfolder paths for easy navigation.
- **Advanced Filename Management:** Features robust sanitization, collision avoidance with numeric counters, and support for custom delimiters and padding.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Saves images in PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, BMP, and WEBP formats, with options for DPI, quality, lossless compression, and optimization.
- **Automatic Directory Creation:** Creates output folders on-the-fly if they don't exist, ensuring seamless saving.
- **Civitai Compatibility:** Extracts model, Lora, and embedding hashes in Civitai's expected format for metadata sharing.

### Placeholder System
The node supports placeholders in both output paths and filename prefixes for dynamic value insertion. Placeholders are replaced with actual values at save time; unknown or empty placeholders default to readable alternatives.

Supported placeholders:
- `%today`, `%date` — Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `%time` — Current time (HHMMSS)
- `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%S` — Individual date/time components
- `%basemodel`, `%model` — Model names (base model and full model)
- `%seed`, `%sampler_name`, `%scheduler`, `%steps`, `%cfg`, `%denoise`, `%clip_skip` — Generation parameters

Example: `%today\%basemodel\%seed_%sampler_name_%steps` creates organized folder structures like `2025-09-27\ModelName\12345_euler_20`.

### Connection Possibilities
- **Direct Image Input:** Connect any image output to the `images` input for standard saving scenarios.
- **Pipe Input:** Connect a metadata pipe (from context or logic nodes) to `pipe_opt` to save images and extract metadata from complex workflows automatically.
- **Hybrid Usage:** Combine both inputs for maximum flexibility, allowing images from one source and metadata from another.

### Generation Data Saving
When the `save_generation_data` option is enabled:
- Embeds all generation parameters (prompts, model names, sampler settings, seed, CFG, steps, etc.) into image metadata.
- Optionally saves the full workflow as a separate JSON file alongside each image.
- Extracts and includes short SHA-256 hashes for models, Loras, and embeddings in Civitai-compatible format.
- Supports prompt removal for privacy and Lora token appending for full traceability.

## Node Spotlight: Checkpoint Loader v3/v4 Series [RvTools-X]

- **Extension Validation:** Prefers .safetensors/.sft files and warns on legacy extensions for safety.
- **Defensive Input Handling:** Normalizes boolean inputs and handles edge cases gracefully.
- **Embedding Directory Support:** Loads embeddings from configured directories during checkpoint loading.
- **Model Name Preservation:** Includes model and VAE names in pipe for downstream reference.

### Connection Possibilities
- **Pipe Output:** Connect the pipe output to any node expecting a standardized pipe (samplers, KSamplers, etc.).
- **Component Extraction:** Use pipe passer nodes to extract individual components (model, CLIP, VAE) for custom workflows.
- **Metadata Integration:** Pipe includes generation-ready metadata for samplers and other downstream nodes.

These loaders are essential for complex workflows requiring precise control over model loading, CLIP ensembles, and memory management.

## The Pipe Ecosystem of [RvTools-X]

The pipe ecosystem in ComfyUI-RvTools-X is a sophisticated data interchange system designed to standardize and simplify the flow of complex data structures through ComfyUI workflows. Pipes act as containers that bundle related parameters, models, and settings into single, manageable objects, eliminating the need for dozens of individual node connections.

### Core Concept

A pipe is fundamentally a Python dictionary that encapsulates multiple related pieces of data. Instead of connecting separate wires for model, CLIP, VAE, latent tensor, dimensions, sampler settings, and metadata, all of this information can be passed through a single pipe connection. This approach dramatically reduces workflow complexity and improves maintainability.

### Pipe Types and Variants

#### Context Pipes
Context pipes are the foundation of the ecosystem, holding the core components of a generation pipeline:

- **Basic Context (`Context [RvTools-X]`):** Standard pipeline context containing model, CLIP, VAE, conditioning (positive/negative), latent, sampler/scheduler, generation parameters (steps, cfg, seed, dimensions), and text prompts.
- **Video Context (`Context Video [RvTools-X]`):** Extended context for video workflows, adding video-specific parameters like frame rate, frame load cap, skip frames, select every nth frame, and audio/image inputs/outputs.
- **WVW Video Context (`Context Video (WVW) [RvTools-X]`):** Specialized for WAN Video Workflows, supporting WANVIDEOMODEL and WANTEXTENCODER types with additional video processing parameters.

#### Generation Data Pipes
These pipes focus on sampler and generation settings:

- **Generation Data (`Generation Data [RvTools-X]`):** Contains sampler/scheduler names, steps, cfg, seed, dimensions, text prompts, model/VAE names, LoRA names, denoise strength, and CLIP skip settings.

#### Sampler Settings Pipes
Specialized pipes for different sampling configurations:

- **Sampler Settings Small:** Basic sampler/scheduler, steps, and CFG.
- **Sampler Settings (Flux+Seed):** Flux-specific guidance, denoise, and seed.
- **Sampler Settings Small (Flux):** Compact Flux settings without seed.
- **Sampler Settings NI (Flux):** Noise Injection Parameters + Generations settings.
- **Sampler Settings NIS (Flux):** Noise Injection Parameters + Seed + Generations settings.

### Key Abilities

#### 1. Standardized Data Interchange
- **Dict-Style Format:** All pipes use consistent dictionary structures with canonical key names.
- **Type Safety:** Each pipe component has defined types (MODEL, CLIP, VAE, LATENT, INT, FLOAT, STRING, etc.).
- **Extensibility:** New fields can be added without breaking existing workflows.

#### 2. Workflow Simplification
- **Reduced Connections:** Bundle 10+ parameters into single connections.
- **Cleaner Layouts:** Workflows become more readable and easier to debug.
- **Modular Design:** Components can be mixed and matched across different pipeline types.

#### 3. Data Manipulation Capabilities
- **Pipe Concatenation:** Merge multiple pipes using strategies (overwrite, preserve, merge).
- **Component Extraction:** Extract individual elements (model, CLIP, VAE, latent) from pipes.
- **Context Building:** Construct pipes from scratch or modify existing ones.

#### 4. Advanced Features
- **Latent Generation:** Automatic latent tensor creation based on dimensions and batch size.
- **Metadata Preservation:** Maintain model names, VAE names, LoRA lists for reference.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and validation for missing or invalid data.
- **Memory Optimization:** Support for different weight dtypes and CLIP trimming.

### Pipe Output Nodes

Specialized nodes extract specific data from pipes:

- **Pipe Out Checkpoint Loader:** Extracts model, CLIP, VAE, latent, dimensions, batch size, and names.
- **Pipe Out Project Folder:** Extracts dimensions, batch size, latent, and path for project workflows.
- **Pipe Out Project Folder Video:** Video-specific extraction with frame parameters.
- **Pipe Out Sampler Settings:** Extracts all sampler and generation parameters.

### Practical Applications

#### Complex Workflows
Pipes excel in workflows requiring multiple model components, ensemble CLIP setups, or video processing pipelines where managing dozens of individual connections becomes impractical.

#### Batch Processing
When processing multiple images or videos with consistent settings, pipes allow settings to be defined once and reused across batch operations.

#### Modular Pipeline Construction
Build reusable pipeline segments that can be connected together, with pipes handling the data flow between modules.

#### Memory Management
Pipes support efficient memory usage through dtype control and component lazy loading.

### Best Practices

- **Use Dict Pipes:** Prefer dict-style pipes over legacy tuple formats for maximum compatibility.
- **Validate Components:** Use pipe output nodes to ensure all required components are present.
- **Merge Strategically:** When concatenating pipes, choose appropriate merge strategies (merge for combining, overwrite for replacement).
- **Type Consistency:** Ensure pipe components match expected types for downstream nodes.
- **Documentation:** Include pipe metadata (model names, settings) for workflow reproducibility.

The pipe ecosystem transforms ComfyUI workflow construction from a web of individual connections into a streamlined, professional data flow system capable of handling the most complex AI generation pipelines.
